# MiniCalc

A little Go GUI tool.

MiniCalc provides an evaluating calculator, a Go Regexp evaluator, some
conversions (e.g., feet ↔ meters) and a keyboard accelerator hinter. In
addition, it shows the ASCII codes (and names for < 32) and also provides a
custom page (which I use to show some of my Git and Go aliases—see the
Options tab to change this to what you want).

Can be built for Linux and Windows.

`minicalc.exe` is a Windows 64-bit binary (4.5MB SHA256
be80e0bdb95f03b30148ecd58f8f337788b68dbdd9abcd9d621166f9a826dd94).
