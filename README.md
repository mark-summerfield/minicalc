# MiniCalc

A little Go GUI tool.

MiniCalc provides an evaluating calculator, a Go Regexp evaluator, and a
keyboard accelerator hinter. In addition, it shows the ASCII codes (and
names for < 32) and also provides a custom page (which I use to show some of
my Git and Go aliasesâ€”see the Options tab to change this to what you want).

Can be built for Linux and Windows.

`minicalc.exe` is a Windows 64-bit binary
(SHA256 53cd803c94a32a89051b136bcb03ff4657ef6defb3f01737540dd49b45a822ad).
